Fenwick. The Venerable Showers of Beauty Gamelan originated in a village near Semarang, Central Java, Indonesia in approximately 1880.</p>

Since 1980, the Venerable Showers of Beauty has performed at hundreds of events and performances around the Northwest. In 2014, Portland has been fortunate to add a gamelan to Portland State University’s School of Music, by a generous donation of Maryland based composer, Robert Macht.</p>

                    <p class="topPadding">A gamelan is an orchestra made up of a set of instruments from Java and Bali, Indonesia. In learning gamelan music, unlike western orchestral music, a musician will learn more than just one instrument. In order to understand gamelan, it is necessary to know what each instrument provides to the whole. During the performance, you will see us moving around and switching instruments. The instruments in the gamelan can be separated into four distinct categories, each serving a different function in the music. The first is the balungan. This group plays the main melody, usually playing on the beat in a steady pattern. The next set of instruments is the elaborating instruments.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="eight columns omega">
                    <p class="atopPadding topPadding">These instruments take the main melody and enhance it with patterns (cengkok) based on the notes played by the balungan. The next group is called the accentuating instruments. Instead of elaborating on the melody, these serve to punctuate the music, playing on certain beats or at the end of a piece or a phrase (listen for the big gong). The last group of instruments are the drums, called the kendhang, ciblon and ketipung, depending on the size. These instruments act as a conductor would in an orchestra, regulating the tempo by controlling beginnings, transitions and endings. And of course, as in anything, there are always exceptions to these rules.</p>
